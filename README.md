## General info
Use java concurrency packages to write a queue that supports multi-writer and multi-reader, i.e. the writer pushes the stuff into the queue and the reader pops the stuff out the queue. All the writer's stuff can't be lost and must be into the queue, and each reader can't pops out the same stuff. Think of how you would simulate the situation and perform the testing. Using the java blocking queue is not allowed.
